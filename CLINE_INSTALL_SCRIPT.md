# GitHub Enterprise MCP Installation Script for Cline

Copy and paste the following text into Cline to have it guide you through installing the GitHub Enterprise MCP server:

```
I want you to help me install the GitHub Enterprise MCP server. Here's what I need you to do:

1. First, explain what the GitHub Enterprise MCP server is and what capabilities it will give you.

2. Guide me through the installation process:
   - Help me clone the repository (if I haven't already)
   - Help me install dependencies and build the project
   - Guide me through creating a GitHub Personal Access Token if I don't have one
   - Help me configure the MCP settings in either VS Code or Claude Desktop
   - Verify the installation is working

3. Show me some examples of how I can use the GitHub Enterprise MCP server once it's installed.

Please start by explaining what the GitHub Enterprise MCP server is and what it will allow you to do for me.
```

After Cline helps you install the GitHub Enterprise MCP server, you can ask it to perform GitHub operations directly, such as:

- "Create a new repository called 'my-project'"
- "Search for repositories related to machine learning"
- "Create a pull request from my feature branch to main"
- "Get the contents of the README.md file in repository X"
- "List open issues in my repository"

The GitHub Enterprise MCP server enables Cline to interact with GitHub on your behalf, making it easier to manage your GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more without leaving your Cline environment.
